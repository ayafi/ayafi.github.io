Hi there, 
My name is Andrew. Automation Engineer. Location: Munich, Germany

This is my blog about software automation (main theme) and sometimes going to post some articles on life in Germany, Politics etc. etc. Those post are going to have their own area though. 

The theme i'm using is  **So Simple Theme** created by by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).
Thanks, Michael!
